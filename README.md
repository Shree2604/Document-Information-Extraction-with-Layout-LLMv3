# Identifying Keys, Values, Headers, and Others from Documents using Layout LLMv3

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of **Layout LLMv3** for document processing, specifically focusing on extracting key information such as **keys**, **values**, **headers**, and other relevant elements from structured or semi-structured documents. The model leverages the power of deep learning and natural language processing to automatically identify and classify different components of a document.

## Key Features

* Automatic extraction of keys and values from documents.
* Detection and classification of headers and other textual elements.
* Utilization of Layout LLMv3 for enhanced document layout understanding.
* Suitable for processing various document types, including invoices, receipts, forms, and reports.
* Easily extensible for integration with other NLP or document processing frameworks.

## Technologies Used

* Layout LLMv3
* Python
* PyTorch
* TensorFlow (optional)

This project serves as a foundation for document information extraction tasks, streamlining workflows that require automatic document parsing and structured data extraction.
